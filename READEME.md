# mtgTable

A simple way to keep track of player's life point, counters, commanders, etc

1 - Improvements need to be made, such as:
  1.1 - Partner when there's no partner
  1.2 - Implement pseuRNG/RNG (D4, D20 and coin) *DONE*
  1.3 - Create commander's field for each player's 'showcase'(e.g.  when adding my Meren commander, adding a field for other player's showing Meren's damage on them)
