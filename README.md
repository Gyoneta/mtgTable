# mtgTable

A simple way to keep track of player's life point, counters, commanders, etc

1 - Improvements need to be made, such as:
1.1 - Partner when there's no partner _DONE_
1.2 - Implement pseuRNG (D4, D20 and coin) _DONE_ (still need the coin system) _DONE_
1.3 - Create commander's field for each player's 'showcase'(e.g. when adding my Meren commander, adding a field for other player's showing Meren's damage on them) _DONE_ (still need to improve)

2 - Testing on Git/GitHub _DONE_

3 - Use API to fetch commander's imgs

4 - WebSocket so people can checkout the score on their own
